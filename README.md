# My Data Science Degree

This is an aggregate of the materials I studied in an attempt to become a data scientist. I call it my own data science "degree". 

Not all of these have certificates and this is not the goal. My goal is to create a place to keep the things I studied together. This can be to easily help people beggining as well, to remember myself how much I studied and to avoid my insecurity sometimes. :)
